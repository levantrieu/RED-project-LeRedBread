- Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync
- Git and GitHub

**Personal Summary**

I really enjoyed working with the WordPress platform. At first it was a hurdle to find my way around a site structure that I did not build, but as I begin to work more with it the structure begins to make sense. I especially love being able to create widgets so that anyone can easily update the site. As a thought for the future, I would like to take more time before jumping into coding, to have a plan on how to apply CSS more efficiently and identify areas that could be widgets.
